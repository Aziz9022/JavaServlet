This code demonstrates the use of **non-blocking I/O** in a **Java Servlet-based web application**. It consists of four components that interact to process a file (`booklist.txt`) stored in the server and asynchronously stream its content to the client using servlets. Letâ€™s break down each part:

---

### 1. **`index.html`**
This is a basic HTML file with a redirect mechanism.

- The `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=NonBlockingServlet">` tag automatically redirects the user to the `NonBlockingServlet` when the page loads.
- Purpose: It serves as the starting point of the application, automatically initiating the servlet process.

---

### 2. **`ReadingNonBlockingServlet.java`**
This servlet is configured to handle non-blocking input streams.

- **Annotations**:
  - `@WebServlet`: Configures the servlet with a name and URL pattern `/ReadingNonBlockingServlet`. The `asyncSupported=true` enables asynchronous request handling.
- **Workflow**:
  1. It sets the `Content-Type` of the response to HTML.
  2. An **`AsyncContext`** is started, enabling asynchronous processing of the request.
  3. The `ServletInputStream` is obtained from the request object.
  4. A `ReadingListener` is attached to handle asynchronous events (e.g., when data is available, fully read, or an error occurs).

---

### 3. **`NonBlockingServlet.java`**
This servlet handles the main file-reading process and sends the content to the `ReadingNonBlockingServlet`.

- **Workflow**:
  1. Responds with a basic HTML page (`File Reader`) and sets the response type to HTML.
  2. Reads the file `booklist.txt` located at `/WEB-INF/booklist.txt`.
     - Uses `ServletContext.getResourceAsStream()` to access the file.
     - `BufferedReader` reads the file content line by line.
  3. Constructs a URL to the `ReadingNonBlockingServlet` (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/...`).
  4. Opens an HTTP connection to this servlet using `HttpURLConnection`.
     - Enables chunked streaming mode and sets `doOutput=true` to send the file content asynchronously.
  5. Sends the file content line by line:
     - Writes each line to the `BufferedWriter` connected to `ReadingNonBlockingServlet`.
     - Simulates a delay of 1 second per line using `Thread.sleep(1000)` to demonstrate real-time streaming.
  6. Closes resources and ensures output is flushed.
  7. Displays "Reading Completed..." when done.

### 4. **`ReadingListener.java`**
This is a custom listener class that implements the `ReadListener` interface to handle non-blocking input events.

- **Key Fields**:
  - `ServletInputStream input`: The input stream to read data from.
  - `AsyncContext ac`: The context that manages asynchronous operations.
- **Methods**:
  - `onDataAvailable()`: Triggered when new data is available to read from the input stream.
    - Currently empty, as no specific handling is implemented for data chunks.
  - `onAllDataRead()`: Triggered when all data has been read.
    - Completes the asynchronous operation by calling `ac.complete()`.
  - `onError(Throwable t)`: Triggered if an error occurs during reading.
    - Completes the asynchronous operation and prints the stack trace of the error.

---

### **How It Works Together**

1. The user accesses `index.html`, which redirects them to `NonBlockingServlet`.
2. `NonBlockingServlet` reads the `booklist.txt` file and streams its content to the `ReadingNonBlockingServlet` asynchronously.
3. The `ReadingNonBlockingServlet` processes the incoming data using the `ReadingListener`, which handles data events and ensures the asynchronous operation completes once all data is read.
4. The user sees the streamed content of `booklist.txt` displayed line by line in real-time with a 1-second delay between lines.

---

### **Purpose of Non-Blocking I/O**
- Improves **server efficiency** by allowing the servlet to handle other tasks while waiting for I/O operations (e.g., reading or writing data).
- Ensures **scalability**, as the server can process multiple requests simultaneously without being blocked by slow operations.
